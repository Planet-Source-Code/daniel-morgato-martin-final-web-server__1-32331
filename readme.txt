    Complete and pretty designed web server that has many utilities implemented. 
The client (IE or another web browser), can list folders, files and download 
them remotely; can also send anonym mails (without using an external SMTP server);
play a sound file, open/close CD door, send a message and leave impressions in a 
guestbook. It has also a counter, log file writing, and an 'index' page that 
disponibilizes the features listed above.

    You can extract these files into any directory and press RUN in VB toolbar.
However, it would be better if you compile the project first, so color cursors
would appear...
    When the application is started, simply go to a web browser, e.g IE, and
type  http://localhost/  in the adress bar. If you are connected to the 
internet then all people in the world can test the project by replacing the value
localhost by your own IP adress or domain name.

VB6/Win98 Compatible.

Enjoy!
